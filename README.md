## üìã Prerequisites

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose (v1 or v2)
- Bash shell
- PostgreSQL client tools (for database operations)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gzctf-demo
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x thelol.sh
```

3. Configure your environment (optional):
```bash
# Override project name if needed
export PROJECT_NAME_OVERRIDE=my-gzctf-instance
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Show help
./thelol.sh help

# Start all services
./thelol.sh up all

# Start specific profiles
./thelol.sh up api worker

# Stop all services
./thelol.sh down

# View service status
./thelol.sh status

# View logs
./thelol.sh logs -f gzctf
```

### Service Management

```bash
# Restart services
./thelol.sh restart gzctf

# Build images
./thelol.sh build

# Pull latest images
./thelol.sh pull

# Execute command in container
./thelol.sh exec db psql --user postgres -d gzctf

# Open shell in container
./thelol.sh shell gzctf
```

### Database Administration

```bash
# Initialize admin user
./thelol.sh init-admin username

# Example: Make user 'admin' an administrator
./thelol.sh init-admin admin
```

### Maintenance

```bash
# Clean up networks
./thelol.sh prune

# Full cleanup (destructive)
./thelol.sh clean --force

# List available profiles
./thelol.sh profiles

# Show compose files being used
./thelol.sh files
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```
gzctf-demo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml      # Main compose configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appsettings.json       # Application settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thelol.sh             # Main management script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init_admin.sh         # Legacy admin init script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

## üîß Configuration

### Docker Compose Files

The script automatically detects and uses:
- `docker-compose.yml` (required)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (optional, if exists)

### Environment Variables

- `PROJECT_NAME_OVERRIDE`: Override the default project name
- `NO_COLOR`: Disable colored output

### Services

- **gzctf**: Main GZCTF application (port 8080)
- **db**: PostgreSQL database
- **cache**: Redis cache

## üéØ Admin Management

The `init-admin` command provides automated user role management:

### What it does:
1. Verifies database service is running
2. Updates user role to admin in `AspNetUsers` table
3. Verifies the change was successful
4. Provides clear feedback on the operation

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Make user 'admin' an administrator
./thelol.sh init-admin admin

# Make user 'dimas' an administrator  
./thelol.sh init-admin dimas
```

### Manual Database Access:
```bash
# Connect to database directly
./thelol.sh exec db psql --user postgres -d gzctf

# Check user roles
./thelol.sh exec db psql --user postgres -d gzctf -c "SELECT \"UserName\", \"Role\" FROM \"AspNetUsers\";"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service not running:**
```bash
# Check service status
./thelol.sh status

# Start services
./thelol.sh up all
```

**Database connection issues:**
```bash
# Check database logs
./thelol.sh logs db

# Restart database
./thelol.sh restart db
```

**Permission issues:**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x thelol.sh

# Run with proper permissions
sudo ./thelol.sh up all
```

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View all logs
./thelol.sh logs

# Follow logs in real-time
./thelol.sh logs -f

# View specific service logs
./thelol.sh logs -f gzctf
```

## üîí Security Notes

- The `init-admin` command modifies database directly
- Ensure proper database credentials are configured
- Use strong passwords for production environments
- Regularly backup your database
